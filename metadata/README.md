# ISO19139 Metadata files
This folder is used to store ISO19139 metadata files (`XML`). Metadata is essential for describing and providing context to your data. By keeping metadata files, you can ensure that your data is properly documented, discoverable, and reusable.

## Usage
`ckan2pycsw` save your ISO19139 metadata files in this folder. Each file should correspond to a dataset or resource that you want to describe. The filename should be descriptive and unique to the dataset or resource.
